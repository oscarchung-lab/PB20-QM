# PB20-QM
Our drug/inhibitor molecules downloaded from PDBbind v2020 dataset were used to set up a benchmark dataset (denoted as PB-20-QM), which contains 12,963 drug/inhibitor molecules after removing metal-containing systems. The protonation states of all these molecules remain preserved as those in the PDBbind v2020 dataset, except for minor corrections (to fix very poor or wrong positions of H atoms based on their corresponding PDB structures) to some molecules. Geometry optimization for all molecules in this PB-20-QM dataset in gas phase were conducted by the above-mentioned DFT (wB97X-D/6-31G(d)) and GFN2-xTB methods.
